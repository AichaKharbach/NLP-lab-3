# NLP-lab-3

## Repository Overview

This repository showcases the work and results from the NLP lab sessions conducted. It is organized into two primary sections, each dedicated to exploring different facets of Natural Language Processing utilizing the Sklearn library.

### Language Modeling and Regression

- **Objective**: Focuses on language modeling and regression tasks.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop words).
  - Embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, Bag of Words, and TF-IDF.
- **Model Training**:
  - Models like SVR, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Using standard metrics like MSE and RMSE.
- **Datasets**:
  - SAG dataset: [View Dataset](https://github.com/dbbrandt/short_answer_granding_capstone_project/blob/master/data/sag/answers.csv)

### Language Modeling and Classification

- **Objective**: Focuses on language modeling for classification purposes.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Similar NLP pipeline as above tailored for sentiment analysis.
- **Model Training**:
  - Classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Ada Boosting.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and F1 score.
- **Datasets**:
  - Twitter sentiment analysis dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis)
